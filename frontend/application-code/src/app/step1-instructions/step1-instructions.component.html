      <p class="section-title">This study consists of three steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            In this step, an idea of a crowdsourcing task (called scenario) will be given to you. 
            You should imagine yourself as a requester who wants to create a task based on that scenario. 
            Therefore, you should create the first version of your crowdsourcing task (including the title 
            and the body of the description). Then click <b>Next</b>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Then, you will see your written description. You should click on the <b>Evaluate Clarity</b> to 
            let the tool evaluate the clarity of your task description and show the scores. Using the scores 
            and other information provided, you need to <b>improve the task clarity</b>. You may edit or add 
            information to the current version of your title or description. You should <b>iteratively</b> do this 
            step, till scores are high or you are satisfied with the clarity level of your task description for 
            crowd workers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            After improving the task description, click on the checkbox <b>The task description clarity 
            is improved and complete</b> to enable the <b>Submit</b> button to proceed to the evaluation form. The 
            versions of your task description will be saved automatically.
